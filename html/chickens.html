    <p>
      The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged
      bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000
      years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
      others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.
